# Text Classification: from bag of word to LSTM
In this project,we develop a model that predicts the tag for a question. The notebook starts with the simplest text processing algorithms (like Bag of Words) and continuous to more complex models(like RNNs, LSTM, ...).

Each question (for example: "How do I sort a dictionary by value?") is labeled with exactly one of the four tags:

* Python
* CSharp
* JavaScript
* Java
  
As our dataset, we use a dataset of 8,000 programming questions from Stack Overflow. Each question is labeld by one of the mentioned tags.

# Conclusion
Although the bag of words model was the simplest model, it showed a better perfromance than other more complex models. It shows that more advanced and complex models always won't outperform simpler models.
